Dependencies:
    I am using Python 3.9.1. I imported sys and matplotlib. 

Building the Code:

Running the Code:
    Make sure 1project/test_text contain the text files you want to run the tokenizer on.
    Navigate to the directory 1project/src/ and type:
        > python tokenizer.py {name of text file you want to run}
    A graph will appear of the inputed file's vocabulary growth. Either save it by clicking the floppy disk icon or click 'x' to close it.
    After closing it, you will see a result of the top 200 most frequent words printed out in terminal and their counts, the number of words in
    the collection, and the number of words in the vocabulary.
